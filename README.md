# Bank-loan-prediction
In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but main source of income of any banks is on its credit line. So they can earn from interest of those loans which they credits. A bankâ€™s profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important. Previous research in this era has shown that there are so many methods to study the problem of controlling loan default. But as the right predictions are very important for the maximization of profits, it is essential to study the nature of the different methods and their comparison. A very important approach in predictive analytics is used to study the problem of predicting loan defaulters (i) Collection of Data, (ii) Data Cleaning and (iii) Performance Evaluation. Experimental tests found that the Logistic regression model has better performance than other models in terms of loan forecasting.
